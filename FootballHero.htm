<b>Description: </b>Ty Lewis is a kid who goes through tons of adversity. His parents passed away and he now lives with his Aunt, Uncle and Cousin. However, they don't care for him too much. He is now forced to start at a new school and they don't treat him much better there. His brother, however, is a highly touted NFL prospect and things might just go in favor of Ty, just this once.</p>
