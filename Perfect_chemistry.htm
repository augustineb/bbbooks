She's forced to be lab partners with Alex Fuentes, a gang member from the other side of town, and he is about to threaten everything she's worked so hard for--her flawless reputation, her relationship with her boyfriend, and the secret that her home life is anything but perfect...There is something about Alex Fuentes, that none of the other boys have! Is Brittany really going to fall for this so-called badboy?</p>
