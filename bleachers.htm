<p><b>Description:</b> An all-american quarterback, Neely Crenshaw, returns home to  Messina, Texas.  Like many other former  football players, they have come for the passing of their legendary high school  coach.  As they sit around the old  football field, they relive past games, rehash old relationships and try to  decide if they love or hate their old football coach.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Inside Scoop:</b> &quot;It’s a hard book to put down.  There are plenty of hidden stories. It’s interesting  to see a town that lives and dies on high school football, and a coach that  pushes his players to their limits, and sometimes even too far.&quot; -<i>Mr. O'Halloran</i></ul>
