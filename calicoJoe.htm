They called up a twenty-one-year-old  named Joe Castle.  Joe quickly became the  biggest name in baseball and had one of the most remarkable, and memorable,  rookie seasons in the history of the game.   He became the idol of the whole country, including a boy named Paul  Tracey.  Paul’s dad was a hard-throwing,  unforgiving major league pitcher.  When  the two ball players met on the baseball diamond, the outcome changed both of  their lives forever.</p>
