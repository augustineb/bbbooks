<p><b>Description:</b> Ten unrelated guests are invited to an unknown island by an unknown host.  One by one the guests are murdered.  They have to find out if it is one of them or is there someone on the island with them?</p>

<ul><li><b>The Inside Scoop:</b> "A great book that keeps one guessing until the end.  It is a mystery without all the sex and drugs to mess it up like current novels.  This book is easy to follow.  You don't have to worry about concurrent story lines.  The characters are easy to like or hate and you can try to guess who will be killed next and who is behind it." - <i>Mr. Rieschick</i></li></ul>
