<p><b>Description:</b> Miles Halter is a boy of many last words. He's memorized many famous figure's dying words. He's bored with his uneventful home life so he attends Culver Creek Boarding School to find his "Great Perhaps". Many things await him there, including Alaska Young. She's clever, funny, and drop dead gorgeous. Miles is sent into her labyrinth in addition to searching for that "Great Perhaps". A great story of first drinks, first pranks, first friends, and first girl. </p>

<ul><li>The Inside Scoop: "This book is amazing. It's almost like you're finding yourself right along with Miles. It's fun and eventful and you never know what Alaska will do or think next. It's a trip through a teenage boy's life at boarding school. You'll never want to put the book down." - <i>Jenna Yocum</i></li></ul>
