Description:</b>
After spending the summer working community service hours at his school, Tyler starts his senior year with newly developed muscles and a bad-boy reputation. When trouble occurs at a high school party, involving the girl of his dreams (who is also his dad's boss's daughter), Tyler is falsely accused. He has no one to turn to for help and must deal with the legal troubles and his hot-tempered father on his own. You will be pulling for him to come out okay!
