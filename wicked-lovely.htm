The things Ash sees the faeries do to each other are horrible.  Her grandmother has always taught her to not acknowledge them.

<ul><li><b>The Inside Scoop: </b>"Wicked Lovely is a book with a little of everything in it.  It has a little action, a little romance, a little fantasy, and a mystery.  Wicked Lovely is a book that would probably be higher on the list for girls."  - <i>Allison Aubert</i></li></ul>
